## ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING

This application implements aggressive countermeasures against sophisticated surveillance. It is designed for users under active nation-state surveillance with confirmed EL2 (hypervisor-level) compromise.

**This system will:**
- Consume significant battery (up to 33% reduction in battery life)
- Generate substantial heat (up to 45°C device temperature)
- Use considerable system resources (45% CPU at maximum threat level)
- Create extensive network traffic for obfuscation

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Security Levels

Configure threat response in `Settings > Security`:

| Threat Level | Chaos | Decoys | Memory | Cache | Network | Action |
|-------------|-------|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0-35% | 10 | 10% | No | No | No | Baseline monitoring |
| 35-65% | 60 | 30% | Yes | No | No | Enhanced protection |
| 65-85% | 100 | 50% | Yes | Yes | No | High security mode |
| 85-95% | 150 | 70% | Yes | Yes | Yes | Maximum disruption |
| 95-100% | 200 | 90% | Yes | Yes | Yes | Nuclear protocol |

### Intimate Protection Mode

For protecting specific conversations:

1. **Long-press** contact name in Molly
2. Select **"Enable Intimate Protection"**
3. System will apply maximum security for this conversation only
4. Other conversations remain at normal security levels

### Network Offloading

To use a Linux server for translation:

1. **Install server** on Linux machine:
   ```bash
   cd server/
   ./install_server.sh
   ./start_server.sh
   ```

2. **Verify discovery** on phone:
   ```
   Settings > Translation > Network Servers
   ```

3. Server will appear automatically via mDNS

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Battery Drain
- Reduce chaos level in Settings
- Disable intimate protection when not needed
- Use network offloading instead of on-device translation

#### Device Overheating
- System automatically reduces chaos at 45°C
- Move to cooler environment
- Reduce security level temporarily

#### Translation Failures
- Check model file integrity
- Verify sufficient storage space
- Restart translation service

#### Input Method Not Working
- Verify FlorisBoard is installed
- Check IME configuration
- Reset input method settings
